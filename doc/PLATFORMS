Besides frequent simulations with Icarus Verilog, FpgaMMIX has been
developed on and currently only support this (slightly old) FPGA
development kit:

    Altera's Nios Dev Kit, Cyclone Edition + Lancelot ($1200)

    FPGA:   Cyclone EP1C20 (20,060 LUT4)
    Memory: 16 MiB SDRAM (32x), 1 MiB SRAM (32x)
    Flash:  CompactFlash, 8 MiB linear flash (8x)
    Other:  Ethernet 100, VGA, dual PS/2, audio out, RS232

        Decent, but expensive and on the small side of FPGA and
	memory.

	I still need to support the SDRAM, CompactFlash, the linear
	flash, and the Ethernet, but the FPGA is getting full.

However it is a pricy option and has a few limitation (notably the
amount of available main memory). Hopefully before too long, FpgaMMIX
will be extended to support other development boards.  Here is a list
of interesting candidates:

  * Xilix's Virtex-4 ML401 Evaluation Platform ($500)

    FPGA:   Virtex-4 XC4LX25 (21,504 LUT4)
    Memory: 64 MiB(**) DDR SDRAM 266 MHz (32x), 1.125 MiB ZBT SRAM (36x)
    Flash:  CompactFlash, 8 MiB Flash (32x)
    Other:  Ethernet 1000, VGA, dual PS/2, USB H&P, RS232, lots of audio

	Good value, small FPGA and a bit short on memory compared to
	the ML501 below, but I happen to have this board.

        (**) Documentation claims it can be reworked to 256 MiB, but AFAICT,
        there is only one extra pin thus enabling only 128 MiB.


  * Xilix's Virtex-5 ML501 Evaluation & Development Platform (n/a $1000)

    FPGA:   Virtex-5 XC5VLX50 (28,800 LUT6 ~= 46,080 LUT4)
    Memory: 256 MiB(***) DDR2 SODIMM (larger can be used), 1 MiB ZBT SRAM
    Flash:  CompactFlash, 32 MiB Flash
    Other:  Ethernet 1000, DVI, dual PS/2, USB H&P, RS232, lots of audio

	Ideal, but not supported by ISE WebPACK!
	DDR2 DIMM => faster, wider, but more complicated

	(***) Supports larger SODIMMs (up to 1 GiB?)


  * Xilinx's Spartan-3E Starter Kit ($150)

    FPGA:   Spartan-3E 500E (10,476 LUT4)
    Memory: 64 MiB DDR SDRAM
    Flash:  16 MiB parallel flash
    Other:  Ethernet 100, VGA, single PS/2, RS232

	Great value, but FPGA is too small. No audio. No flash
	card. VGA wimpy (8 colors)

	FpgaMMIX is obviously highly un-optimized currently, but just
	the core is 14,000+ LUT4, unlikely to be shrunk to 50%.


  * Xilinx's Spartan-3E 1600E MicroBlaze Dev Kit (n/a $600)

    FPGA:   Spartan-3E 1600E (33,192 LUT4)
    The rest as the Spartan-3E Starter Kit above.

	FPGA plenty big.  Rest as with the Spartan-3E Starter Kit.
	The FPGA 50% bigger than the ML401, but the latter have more
	peripherals.



Runner up:

  * Altera's DSP Development Kit, Cyclone-II Edition ($1000)

    FPGA:   Cyclone-II EP2C70 (68,416 LUT4)
    Memory: 256 MiB DDR2 SODIMM, 1 MiB synchronous SRAM
    Flash:  none?
    Other:  VGA, audio

	FPGA and memory is great, but almost everything else is
        missing.


  * Altera's DE2 Development & Education Board ($500, $270 students)

    FPGA:   Cyclone-II EP2C35 (33,215 LUT4)
    Memory: 8 MiB SDRAM, 512 KiB SRAM
    Flash:  SD memory card, 4 MiB Flash
    Other:  Ethernet 100, VGA, single PS/2, Audio, Video in, USB H&P

	*Way* too little main memory
