Besides frequent simulations with Icarus Verilog, FpgaMMIX has been
developed on and currently only support this (slightly old) FPGA
development kit:

    Altera's Nios Dev Kit, Cyclone Edition + Lancelot ($1200) [HAVE THIS]
    (URL no longer available)

    FPGA:   Cyclone EP1C20 (20,060 LUT4)
    Memory: 16 MiB SDRAM (32b), 1 MiB SRAM (32b)
    Flash:  CompactFlash, 8 MiB linear flash (8b)
    Other:  Ethernet 100, 24b VGA, dual PS/2, audio out, RS-232

        Expensive and dated -- small FPGA and memory.

        I still need to support the SDRAM, CompactFlash, the linear
        flash, and the Ethernet, but the FPGA is already getting full.

However it is a pricy option and has a few limitation (notably the
amount of available main memory). Hopefully before too long, FpgaMMIX
will be extended to support other development boards.  Here is a list
of interesting candidates:

  * Xilix's Virtex-4 ML401 Evaluation Platform ($500) [HAVE THIS]
    http://www.xilinx.com/ml401

    FPGA:   Virtex-4 XC4LX25 (21,504 LUT4)
    Memory: 64 MiB(*) DDR SDRAM 266 MHz (32b), 1.125 MiB ZBT SRAM (36b)
    Flash:  CompactFlash, 8 MiB Flash (32b)
    Other:  Ethernet 1000, 24b VGA, dual PS/2, USB H&P, RS-232,
            lots of audio

        Good value.

        (*) Documentation claims it can be reworked to 256 MiB, but AFAICT,
        there is only one extra pin thus enabling only 128 MiB.


  * Digilentinc's Spartan 3E-1600 Development Board ($300) [ORDERED THIS]
    http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=S3E1600&Nav1=Products&Nav2=Programmable

    FPGA:   Spartan-3E 1600E (33,192 LUT4)
    Memory: 32 MiB(**) DDR SDRAM (16b)
    Flash:  16 MiB parallel flash
    Other:  Ethernet 100, 3b VGA, RS-232, D/A & A/D converters,
            DS2432 (EEPROM+SHA1)

        Great value. Apart from FPGA and SDRAM, idential to the
        Spartan-3E Starter Kit below.

        The FPGA is 50% bigger than the ML401, but the latter have
        more peripherals. No audio. No flash card. VGA wimpy. Narrow
        SDRAM.

        (**) The PCB supports a 64 MiB DDR with a rework, but even
        more and wider would have been nice.



Runner up:

  * Xilix's Virtex-5 ML501 Evaluation & Development Platform ($1000)
    http://www.xilinx.com/ml501

    FPGA:   Virtex-5 XC5VLX50 (28,800 LUT6 ~= 46,080 LUT4)
    Memory: 256 MiB(***) DDR2 SODIMM (64b?), 1 MiB ZBT SRAM (32b?)
    Flash:  CompactFlash, 32 MiB Flash
    Other:  Ethernet 1000, DVI, dual PS/2, USB H&P, RS-232, lots of audio

        Ideal platform, but not supported by ISE WebPACK :(
        (DDR2 DIMM => faster, wider, but more complicated)

        (***) Supports larger SODIMMs (up to 1 GiB?)


  * Xilinx's Spartan-3E Starter Kit ($150)
    http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xebiz/designResources/ip_product_details.jsp?key=HW-SPAR3E-SK-US

    FPGA:   Spartan-3E 500E (10,476 LUT4)
    Memory: 64 MiB DDR SDRAM (16b)
    Flash:  16 MiB parallel flash
    Other:  Ethernet 100, 3b VGA, PS/2, RS-232, D/A & A/D converters,
            DS2432 (EEPROM+SHA1)

        Good value, but FPGA is too small. No audio. No flash
        card. VGA wimpy. Narrow SDRAM.

        FpgaMMIX is obviously highly un-optimized currently, but just
        the core is 14,000+ LUT4, unlikely to be shrunk to 50%.


  * Altera's DE2 Development & Education Board ($150)
    http://www.altera.com/products/devkits/altera/kit-cyc2-2C20N.html

    FPGA:   Cyclone-II EP2C20 (18,752 LUT4)
    Memory: 8 MiB SDRAM (16b?), 512 KiB SRAM (?b)
    Flash:  SD memory card, 4 MiB Flash
    Other:  12b VGA, PS/2, Audio, Video in

        Good value, but too little main memory, too small FPGA, and no
        ethernet.


  * Altera's Video Development Kit, Cyclone II Edition ($1100)
    http://www.altera.com/products/devkits/altera/kit-video-cyclone2.html

    FPGA:   Cyclone-II EP2C70 (68,416 LUT4)
    Memory: 256 MiB DDR2 SODIMM (64b?), 1 MiB synchronous SRAM (32b?)
    Flash:  none?
    Other:  24b VGA, audio

        Expensive. FPGA and memory is great, but almost everything
        else is missing.
