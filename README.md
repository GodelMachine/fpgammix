Partial implementation of Knuth's MMIX processor (FPGA softcore)

This is a quick and dirty hack, but complete enough to run various graphics demos.

The motivation behind this was to evaluate MMIX as a softcore.  My preliminary conclusion
is that it's not ideal and my effort is better directed at other targets, such as RISC V
(http://riscv.org).

The implementation is left here for posterity, but there are bits and pieces that may be
useful.
